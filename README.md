# MNIST image predictions using LogisticRegression and K-Nearest Neighbor algorithms.

This repository holds algorithms using sklearn Python package for implementing these algorithms. I wrote this file, with aknowledgments given, to fulfill a graduate-level course. The ECEN 689 graduate course objective was to train, predict, and list these algorithm to the MNIST 60,000 image set. The algorithms were
then tested on the 10,000 image test set. 

* For the Logistic Regression algorithm, the error rate hovers around 7.5% , and takes ususally 81 seconds to finish on my system (specs listed below).

* K-Nearest neighbors error rate is approximately 5.3 %, with time duration of 310 seconds on my sytem.
